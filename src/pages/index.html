    Why Hire a UI Designer
    
    A Stunning UI Will Elevate Your Business
    
    Startups/Solopreneurs
    
    First impressions are critical so your interface should look amazing, your reputation depends on it. A clean, modern and intuitive interface will create trust and make an immediate impact to your new business. Don’t sell your amazing idea short with a lacklustre and boring design.
    
    Developers
    
    Even with a skill list as long as your arm, you’re never guaranteed clients will pick you over the 1000’s of other devs out there. Adding a clean, modern and intuitive interface to your well-coded app or website makes all the difference. Get both right and you’ll land better, higher paying projects.

    “I’ve worked with Marcus on several websites. He is a rare combination of keen design sense coupled with modern workflow (Sketch 3 and Zeplin). He makes my life as a developer easier. He handles the design freeing me up to focus on the code.”
